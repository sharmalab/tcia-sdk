TCIA-SDK: A REST-API Client for TCIA
=====================================

This repository consists of SDK developed in Java and Python that can be used to access The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) REST API securely. 

It also offers an authentication interface and implements it against the ldap-based authentication mechanisms of TCIA v4 and v3.

To include this in your maven-based project, have a look at the [TCIA-SDK Java Client](https://github.com/sharmalab/tcia-sdk/tree/dev/tcia-rest-client-java)
